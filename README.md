# Basic Module federation example

This example demos a basic host application loading a remote component.

- `host` is the host application.
- `remote` remote app which exposes `Button` component.

# Running Demo

 Go into each folder and run npm install this will run the host on port 3001 and the remote on port 3002

 In your browser open both:
 - [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (REMOTE)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (HOST)


 Alternativelly you can also start from scratch:

 1. Go to the console and type npx create-mf-app.

 2. You will be asked several questions to setup your project.

 3. Pick the ones of your choice and let's begin.
